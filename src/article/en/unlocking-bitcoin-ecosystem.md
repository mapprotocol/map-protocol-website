# Unlocking the Bitcoin ecosystem with MAP Protocol

Bitcoin network may have the most robust security. Since the first transaction block in 2009, the network has never once shut down, nor has any Bitcoin ever been stolen from the blockchain. Yet due to the lack of Turing completeness, Bitcoin is limited in its usability compared to Ethereum, and its ecosystem grows slowly. Ethereum and its EVM ecosystem, on the other hand, expand rapidly and capture most peopleâ€™s attention.

However, with the development of BCR-20 and Bitcoin Layer 2 infrastructure, new possibilities for enhancing the Bitcoin ecosystem have emerged. Here are the potential outcomes that MAP Protocol can facilitate for Bitcoin:

# Greater Interoperability in the Bitcoin Ecosystem

As the Layer 0 of all Bitcoin Layer 2s, MAP Protocol allows any assets on Bitcoin L2 or other ecosystems' chains to easily achieve interoperability. This will facilitate interoperation among numerous Bitcoin Layer 2 network assets and integrate further assets and communities into the existing Bitcoin ecosystem. Through this, Bitcoin will not only serve as a means of value storage, but also expand its interoperability and pave the way for decentralized applications and innovations.

# Enhanced BRC-20 liquidity

The [BRC-201 protocol](/article?id=from-BRC-20-to-EVMs), a cross-chain expansion protocol, enables BRC-20 and ORC-20 assets on the Bitcoin network to cross-chain and migrate to MAP Protocol, a Bitcoin Layer 2 and an interoperable all-chain infrastructure. This cross-chain capability will allow BRC-20 tokens on the Bitcoin network to interact with tokens on other public chains, thus increasing the market liquidity of BRC-20 tokens.

With MAP Protocol, a peer-to-peer cross-chain interoperability network, members of the BRC-20 community can more conveniently and cost-effectively transact with tokens on other chains. This layer of cross-chain interoperability on the Bitcoin network will also contribute to the growth of the entire Bitcoin community.

# Better and safer Bitcoin trading option

Despite the increasing use of Bitcoin as a sovereign money or reserve option, Bitcoin itself is not as productive an asset as it should be. To trade Bitcoin, people need to either go through separate blockchains in the form of wrapped BTC or trusted custodians. Both options have their safety issues:



* Wrapped BTC depends on the smart contract that issues them. In other words, wrapping itself cannot be automated via a smart contract on those smart contract blockchains, but is done by a central program, which opens for manipulation.
* The trustworthiness of many of the coins offered in exchange is questionable, especially if there is no strong regulatory legal framework and requirements for those exchanges issuing their wrapped BTC.

Given wrapping on a smart contract chain still cannot avoid the issue of centralization, a trusted but regulated custodian would seem a safer and more logical option for trading Bitcoin or any other digital assets without Turing completeness. As part of the Bitcoin community, MAP Protocol will actively explore ways and seek collaboration with qualified custodians to empower safer Bitcoin trading.
