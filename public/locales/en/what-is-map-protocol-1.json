  "Summary": "Summary",
  "MAP Protocol provides the essential omnichain infrastructure for achieving interoperability among blockchain-based assets, storage, and computing. Built upon the light client and zero-knowledge proof technology, our interoperable cross-chain solution is peer-to-peer, without any trusted third-party entities. The MAP Protocol network serves as a Web3 user gateway and developer portal, empowering users and developers to use and build anything cross-chain in a peer-to-peer way.": "MAP Protocol is an omnichain infrastructure for BTC, stablecoin, and tokenized asset swaps. MAP Protocol leverages light client technology and MPC-based TSS to build an interoperable bridge between the Bitcoin mainnet, multi-chain stablecoin and tokenized asset ecosystems (including Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Tron, Solana, and more), enabling fast, secure, and seamless swaps between BTC and stablecoins, as well as among stablecoins.",
  "You can create a MAP Protocol account from anywhere, at any time, and explore omnichain apps or build your own. The core innovation is that you can do all things cross-chain without trusting a central authority that could change the rules or restrict your access.": "",
