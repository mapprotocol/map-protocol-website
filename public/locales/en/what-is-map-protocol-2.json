  "Blockchain gaming has changed this old gaming modality. Web3 projects such as Crypto Kitties, Axie Infinity, and Dark Forest have created a new gaming paradigm where players are encouraged to trade in-game items and are rewarded for their playtime. As with many first-time innovations, however, those blockchain gaming projects are far from perfect and have turned off true gamers due to scalability issues, transaction fees, and the complexity of managing blockchain-based assets.": "Blockchain gaming has changed this old gaming modality.

  "This is where omnichain and fully on-chain gaming comes in. Through MAP Protocol, GameFi projects can not only have gaming assets tradable and interoperable on all chains but all aspects of game state, logic, and data on the blockchain, so blockchain gaming becomes an autonomous world where players have their full agency and contribute to the development of the game.": "This is where omnichain and fully on-chain gaming comes in.

  "Today, most interoperability solutions only emphasize asset cross-chain transactions. However, a truly interoperable Web3 future extends beyond that — it's a future where dApp operations including transactions, data storage, and computing are performed on the blockchain and are interoperable across different chains, giving users full control over their data and privacy.": "Today, most interoperability solutions only emphasize asset cross-chain transactions.
