    "Generally, staking is the process of participating in a proof-of-stake (PoS) or a similar consensus mechanism to support the operations of a blockchain network. Participants lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet to help validate transactions, secure the network, and produce new blocks. In return, participants usually receive additional tokens as rewards, potentially leading to a stream of passive income.": "Generally, staking is the process of participating in a proof-of-stake (PoS) or a similar consensus mechanism to support the operations of a blockchain network.
