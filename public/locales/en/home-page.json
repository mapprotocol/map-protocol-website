    "MAP Protocol serves as a Bitcoin layer-2 dedicated to Bitcoin ecosystem development. It also provides the essential infrastructure for achieving interoperability among blockchain-based assets, storage, and computing. Built upon the light client and zero-knowledge proof technology, our interoperable cross-chain solution is peer-to-peer, without any trusted third-party entities, thus turning siloed blockchains or blockchains using third-party bridges into an all-in-one Web3 development platform and Web3 user gateway.": "MAP Protocol is the omnichain infrastructure for BTC, stablecoin, and tokenized asset swaps. It leverages <link1>light client technology</link1> and MPC-based TSS to build an interoperable bridge connecting the Bitcoin mainnet with multi-chain stablecoin and tokenized asset ecosystems (Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Tron, Solana, and more), enabling efficient, secure, and seamless cross-chain swaps between BTC, stablecoins, and tokenized assets.\n\nIts interoperability solution is peer-to-peer, without any reliance on trusted third-party entities. This transforms Bitcoin networks or blockchains using third-party bridges into an integrated, end-to-end one-stop swap system for BTC and stablecoins, serving as the gateway for Web3 users to swap BTC, stablecoins, and tokenized assets.",

    "The case for MAP Protocol as Bitcoin layer-2": "MAP Protocol as Infrastructure for End-to-End BTC and Stablecoin Swaps",
    "Due to the lack of Turing completeness, Bitcoin is limited in its usability compared to Ethereum, and its ecosystem grows slowly. As a Bitcoin layer-2 and an interoperable omnichain infrastructure, MAP Protocol is able to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem’s interoperability and fuel the growth of the Bitcoin community.": "MAP Protocol provides the foundational infrastructure for end-to-end asset swap between BTC, stablecoins, and tokenized assets. It enables true peer-to-peer connectivity between Bitcoin and major blockchain networks.\nBy leveraging Light Client architecture and MPC-based Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), MAP Protocol powers an interoperability network that connects Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Solana, TON, NEAR, Kaia, and more. This makes it possible to build seamless multi-chain stablecoin dApps.",
    "With MAP Protocol’s BRC-201, a cross-chain extension protocol to BRC-20 tokens, BRC-20 and ORC-20 assets on the Bitcoin network can interact with other tokens on other public chains. This layer of Bitcoin network cross-chain interoperability will also grow the Bitcoin community as a whole.": "At the same time, the interoperability network implemented through ZK-LightClient technology allows Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Near, Klaytn, etc. including Conflux, to interact with the Bitcoin ecosystem. This makes building seamless and permissionless Bitcoin Layer 2 applications possible.",
